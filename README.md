# That Shopping List App

## Overview

That Shopping List is a React Native app that allows users to create and manage shopping lists. The app provides an intuitive interface for adding items, checking them off, and organizing shopping trips.

The project consists of two main components:
- **Frontend (Thatshoppinglist):** The React Native app that users interact with.
- **Server:** The backend server responsible for handling data storage and API requests.

## Prerequisites
